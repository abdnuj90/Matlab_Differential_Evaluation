# Matlab_Differenital_Evaluation
The code discusses an evolutionary technique; a differential evaluation algorithm which employed to design the optimal controller leading to the best possible system performance. The differential evaluation (DE) algorithm starts with mutation which generated from random numbers from the initial population. The generated mutant vectors are then perturbed by a crossover operation where a stochastic operation is deployed to choose a trial vector. Finally, the trial vector will be selected in comparison with the original population based on their fitness. The operation is repeated again for several iterations until the maximum number of generation is reached.
